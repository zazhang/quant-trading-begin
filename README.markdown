## Description

This repo recreates the book *Algorithmic Trading Winning Strategies and their Rational* by Ernie Chan.

The original code is in *MATLAB*. Many others have implemented this book in *Python* and helped me a lot during the study process. I try to implement every chapter using *Jupyter Notebook*. In the notebook, I can write down my thought process, therefore, make it easier for others who are interested in learning the book in *Python*.

+ This project is associated with virtural environment **qt-env** and ipykernel **qt**.
